* Euler Finance Incident POC
** The exploit
The hack resulted in the loss of over ~75% of its $264M TVL, and later became utterly REKT (current TVL is only $72k).
This had a domino effect on other protocols, such as Angle Protocol and Balance, as reported on https://rekt.news/euler-rekt/.
This repo contains a POC for the hack using reserve engineering technique based on the [[https://medium.com/@omniscia.io/euler-finance-incident-post-mortem-1ce077c28454][Imniscia Euler Finance Incident Post-Mortem]]

** The [[https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc310a0affe2169d1f6feec1c63dbc7f7c62a887fa48795d327d4d2da2d6b111d][attack transaction]] step-by-step:
1. Flahsloan from AaveV2 (although I did the POC with AaveV3)
2. Transfer the full loan balance to the violator contract
3. Deposit 2/3 to Euler eDAI
4. Create a 10x artificial eDAI leverage
5. Repay half of the DAI violatorâ€™s position, causing their dDAI balance to decrease
6. Create another 10x artificial eDAI leverage
7. Donate half of eDAI (leveraged) balance to the reserve of the eDAI
8. Liquidates the violator position, completing the exploit

** Best practices recommendation
